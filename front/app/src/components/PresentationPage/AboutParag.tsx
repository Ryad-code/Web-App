    <a>Before I stepped into the world of Web development
    I had many various experiences such as Law, Art or Graphic Design.  This journey made me sure about something: I'm passionate about crafting experiences that are engaging, accessible, and user-centric.
    That is why I like to think as myself as a Creative Developer engaged to resolve problems revolving between Development and Design</a>
